# Python-Retro-Console-Emulator
# Mini project written in Python and Pygame which demonstrates a simple retro 2D emulator
# Concists of a simple menu created by TKinter library with two games as components
# Simple snake game and a 3 stage SpaceShip game like the retro Xenon2: Megablast
# This project (created by web resourses like images and background music publiced by other users
# which I lack the skills to produce) was build for self education in game development, image
# and graphic manipulation  and its free for anyone who wants to build something similar or use it as guideline.
# To run on windows just change the paths in every file to your downloaded folder.
# For linux you will also need to change the calling commands of the two games in Menu.py
# which are inside comments, just uncomment them and comment the windows commands.
